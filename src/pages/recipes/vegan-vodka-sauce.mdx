### Ingredients

- 2 Shallots finely chopped
- 1 clove of garlic
- Red pepper flakes to taste(depends on how spicy you want it)
- 1/2 can Coconut Milk
- 1 tube high quality tomato paste
- Olive Oil
- Salt and Pepper
- Nutritional Yeast or Parm
- 1 lb fusili
- Vegan Butter

### Assembly

Heat a large pot of boiling water and don't forget to salt it.

In a separate pot, heat about 1/4 cup of olive oil over medium heat.

Once hot, add in your shallots and cook for a few minutes then add your garlic and red pepper flakes. You can add as many as you want, I literally can't tell you not to.

Once everything is brown and softened, stir in your tomato paste, stirring until it turns into a deep red color.

Next, whisk in, 1/2 can of coconut milk and a little bit of pasta water. Whisking helps keep the sauce together.

Simmer the sauce on low until your pasta is ready.

Once your pasta is ready, drain it and add it to the sauce and increase the heat to medium. Add a few tablespoons of butter and your nutritional yeast. Stir until it looks instagram worthy (a few minutes)
Serve.
